            <p>
                I am a 25 year old Gamer at heart that has been gaming since I can remember. I never really took the time to look into how a game was made until recently when I got introducted into the coding world. 
                I am currently helping dev for a popular game called GTAV (FiveM). This is where my passion for taking the next step in my developing career stems from. For the most part I can understand how to read
                code but wanted to take it a step farther and understand how to write code from scratch so here we are. I have spent the last 6 months self learning coding which has been a journey in itself but felt
                it was time to go back to school to get a better understand. With that being said, when i'm not at my computer I enjoy watching sports and spending quality time with my family along with outdoor adventures.
